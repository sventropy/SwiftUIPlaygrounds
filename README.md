# SwiftUIPlaygrounds

Playgrounds related to SwiftUI

## Background

Playgrounds work with XCode 11 beta on Mojave (Catalina not required), thanks to this [hint on Twitter by John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell/status/1139190006227120128). Note: Combine does not work!

## DynamicList

see `DynamicList.playground`

Goal: Create a list of geo locations and navigate to a mapview
